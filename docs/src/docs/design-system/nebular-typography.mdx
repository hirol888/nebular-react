# Nebular Typography

The main goal of typography is to describe how design is applied to letters and text. Nebular Typography is based on [Eva Design System](https://eva.design?utm_campaign=eva_design%20-%20home%20-%20nebular%20intro&utm_source=nebular&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=nebular_typography) specification.

## Font Family

Nebular theme contains two font-family properties:

- **font_family_primary** - utilized by all text elements on the page
- **font_family_secondary** - utilized by heading elements (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc)

By default both font_family_primary and font_family_secondary use `'Open Sans, sans-serif'` font family names.

## Colors

There are 5 text colors available within the Design System:

- **text_basic_color** - main text color, should be used on top of basic backgrounds, usually cards, sidebars, headers, available as `.text-basic` CSS class which is defined in `GlobalStyles.tsx`
- **text_alternate_color** - alternative color used on top of alternate backgrounds - colored headers, sidebars, available as `.text-alternate` CSS class which is defined in `GlobalStyles.tsx`
- **text_control_color** - should we used as a text color for status backgrounds (`success`, `primary`, etc) - usually buttons, selects , available as `.text-control` CSS class which is defined in `GlobalStyles.tsx`
- **text_disabled_color** - indicates text disabled state, available as `.text-disabled` CSS class which is defined in `GlobalStyles.tsx`
- **text_hint_color** - used by secondary texts - captions, placeholders, labels, available as `.text-hint` CSS class which is defined in `GlobalStyles.tsx`

## Text Styles

Nebular typography consist of 14 text styles, where text styles is a combination of `font-size`, `font-weight`, `line-height` and `font-family` properties:

- **6 heading** styles, used by `<h1>`-`<h6>` elements, also available as CSS classes `.h1`, `.h2` ... `.h6` which is defined in `GlobalStyles.tsx`
- **2 subtitle** styles, used as a text for most of the controls (inputs, menus, etc) with classes `.subtitle`, `.subtitle-2` which is defined in `GlobalStyles.tsx`
- **2 paragraph** styles for regular text and `<p>` element, with classes `.paragraph`, `.paragraph-2` which is defined in `GlobalStyles.tsx`
- **2 caption** styles for smaller text like tooltips and input captions, with classes `.caption`, `.caption-2` which is defined in `GlobalStyles.tsx`
- **label** style, used by `<label>` element as available as `.label` CSS class which is defined in `GlobalStyles.tsx`

## Apply text styles classes and properties

All of the text styles could be applied by simply adding CSS classes to an element:

```html
<input type="email" name="email" /> <span class="caption-2 text-hint">Work email address</span>
```

Here we added both `caption-2` and `text-hint` making the span to be a caption with a hint text color.

## Customize Typography styles

All text styles and colors are available as [Nebular Theme](/design-system/design-system-theme) properties.
This means that all styles could be easily customized by changing theme variables:

```ts
import { DEFAULT_THEME } from '@nebular-react/styles';

export const DarkThemeCore: NebularThemeCore = {
  ...DEFAULT_THEME,
  text_caption_font_family: 'var(--font-family-primary)',
  text_caption_font_size: '0.75rem',
  text_caption_font_weight: 400,
  text_caption_line_height: '1rem'
};
```

Complete list of typography variables could be find at [Default Theme Variables](docs/design-system/default-theme) page.
