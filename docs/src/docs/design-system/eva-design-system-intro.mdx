# Eva Design System

Nebular becomes an implementation of [Eva Design System](https://eva.design/?utm_campaign=eva_design%20-%20home%20-%20nebular%20intro&utm_source=nebular&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=nebular_intro).
This means that components visual style and behavior are based on Design System rules and agreements.

## Principles

Eva is a customizable Design System based on Atomic Design Principles.
All components are built based on basic elements with shared styles, connected with a single Visual Language for both Mobile and Web platforms.
Most importantly, Eva is built to be customizable, meaning architectural support of multiple themes across all components and supporting platforms.

## Built-in themes

Currently, there are 4 built-in themes:

- `default` - clean white theme
- `dark` - dark theme
- `cosmic` - alternative dark violet theme
- `corporate` - firm business theme

Theme extension mechanism allows theme inheritance, for instance, `cosmic` is inherited from the `dark` theme.

Being a part of Eva Ecosystem, Nebular is a great choice for Enterprise-grade products, providing complete control over application look & feel.
