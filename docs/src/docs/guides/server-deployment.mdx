# Server Deployment

Though in the development Nebular app consists of a number of TypeScript, CSS-IN-JS, etc files, the built package is just a bunch HTML/JavaScript/CSS files.
No other processing is needed to get them running in a browser.
So to deploy the app you basically need two simple steps:

- Build your app with `npm run build` or `yarn build`
- Copy the output from the `dist` folder under a web-server of your choice.
