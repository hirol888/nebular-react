# Install Based on Starter Kit

Starting Nebular React from <a href="https://github.com/hirol888/nebular-react-demo" target="_blank">Nebular React Demo</a> starter kit is the easiest way to run your first Nebular React application.

Please note, that **Nebular React Demo** is just a frontend application. Backend integration can be done relatively simple, but you should be aware that all the data is mocked using JavaScript objects.
If you want the data to be dynamic, you should consider developing a backend integration separately.

## Install tools

To install Nebular React Demo on your machine you need to have the following tools installed:

- Git - <a href="https://git-scm.com" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com</a>
- Node.js - <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">https://nodejs.org</a>. Please note the **version** should be **>=14**
- Npm - Node.js package manager, comes with Node.js. Please make sure npm **version** is **>=6**
- You might also need some specific native packages depending on your operating system like `build-essential` on Ubuntu

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hirol888/nebular-react-demo.git

## Run a local copy

To run a local copy in development mode, execute:

```bash
# With yarn
yarn start

# With npm
npm start
```

Go to <a href="http://0.0.0.0:5173" target="_blank">http://0.0.0.0:5173</a> or <a href="http://localhost:5173" target="_blank">http://localhost:5173</a> in your browser.

## Production bundle

To create a bundle in production mode, execute:

```bash
# With yarn
yarn build

# With npm
npm run build
```

This will clear up your `dist` folder (where release files are located) and generate a release build.
Now you can copy the sources from the `dist` folder and use it with any backend framework or simply [put it under a web server](docs/guides/server-deployment).
